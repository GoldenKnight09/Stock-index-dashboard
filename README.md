# Stock & index dashboard (R Shiny)
This is a simple dashboard designed to visualize various stock & index prices.

## Key features:
- Displays stocks & indices on separate graphs (limited to one stock and index at a time).
- Pricing information is displayed using either candlestick (full pricing information) or line (closing price only) visualizations.
  - A visualization of the moving average of the closing price (with a user defined period) can also be added to the candlestick visualization.
- User specified time period for the visualizations.

# Stock & index dashboard
This is a simple dashboard designed to visualize various stock & index prices. There are two versions of it: one is written in R (Shiny) and the other is written in Python (Dash). The two versions are designed to present the information in the same manner as much as possible, the only difference being the language used to write the code.

## Key features:
- Displays stocks & indices on separate graphs (limited to one stock and index at a time).
- Pricing information is displayed using either candlestick (full pricing information) or line (closing price only) visualizations.
  - A visualization of the moving average of the closing price (with a user defined period) can also be added to the candlestick visualization.
- User specified time period for the visualizations.
- Dynamic user interface that updates based on user inputs.

## Live demonstrations of the dashboard in each programming language:
R: hosted on shinyapps.io located [here](https://goldenknight09.shinyapps.io/stock_price_dashboard/).

Python: hosted on TBD located somewhere TBD.
